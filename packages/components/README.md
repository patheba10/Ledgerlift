> Think: “reusable UI pieces that make development faster and consistent within this project.”

- **Scope**: Project-wide, reusable UI components.
- **Purpose**: Provides building blocks for the frontend or app services in this repository. Components are designed to be used across multiple parts of the project, but are typically not meant to be published as a standalone library (unless you later decide to extract them).
- **Examples**:
    - Buttons, inputs, forms, and other UI elements
    - Layout components (headers, footers, grids)
    - Small interactive widgets (modals, tooltips, accordions)
