# Reporting Security Issues

The Monark team and community take security bugs in its projects seriously. While most projects are student-led and not production-ready as documented, we take every opportunity available to improve our process and better guide students in becoming great engineers. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/monark-community/PROJECT_REPOSITORY/security/advisories/new) tab.

The Monark team, or currently active student team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the [npm contact form](https://www.npmjs.com/support) by selecting "I'm reporting a security vulnerability".

## Escalation

If you do not receive an acknowledgement of your report within 6 business days, or if you cannot find a private security contact for the project, you may escalate to the Monark Community team at `security@monark.io`.

If the project acknowledges your report but does not provide any further response or engagement within 14 days, escalation is also appropriate.

## The Monark Security Notification Process

For context on Monark's security notification process, please see the [Notifications](https://github.com/monark-community/governance/blob/main/wg-security/membership-and-notifications.md#notifications) section of the Security WG's [Membership and Notifications](https://github.com/monark-community/governance/blob/main/wg-security/membership-and-notifications.md) Governance document.
